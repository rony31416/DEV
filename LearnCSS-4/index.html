        <p>Within CSS, em and rem are both scalable units that also specify values of properties. em and rem meet web accessibility standards, and, unlike px, scale better. Consequently, they are more suited for responsive design. In this article, we will learn about both the em and rem relative length units. We’ll also go over code examples to demonstrate how they work, their difference, and coding patterns. Lastly, we will learn what problems they solve and when to use each of them. Background information Length values What are em and rem and why use them? em vs. rem Problems with working with em and rem Inheritance of em values Scaling sizing with em and rem CSS libraries using em and rem Background information CSS syntax is rather simple, and, as we discussed previously, involves assigning values to properties of HTML elements. The property-value pair is referred to as a CSS declaration. Consider the code below: h1 { color: black; background-color: rgb(190,43,111,0.5); font-weight: 800; font-size: 1.5rem; padding: 4em; margin: 10px; weight: 100%; height: 100vh; } This code shows a CSS declaration that styles the h1 element of a webpage by assigning specific values to some properties of the element. We see that some properties, such as font-size, padding, and margin, are assigned numerical values. In CSS, there are different numerical value types: Integer: whole numbers, like the value 800 assigned to the font-weight property above Numbers: decimal numbers, like the alpha value passed to the rgb() function expression above. The alpha value is 0.5, referring to 50 percent opacity Percentages: like 100% assigned to the weight property Dimensions: numbers with units, such as 1.5rem, 10px, or 100vh. Dimensions are subdivided into length, angle, time, and resolutions. In our examples above, each of the dimensions (em, px, rem, and vh) fall under the length category Length values Length values are CSS data types assigned to CSS properties, such as weight, height, margin, padding, and font-size. Length values are either absolute or relative. Absolute length values are fixed units, such as px. They are not relative or dependent on anything. Relative length values, however, are not fixed. They are relative to something else, like the browser’s default font size or the font size of other elements. Examples of relative units include em, rem, and vh. As web development evolves with a growing number of devices, scalable units are favored over fixed units because they offer the required flexibility for building responsive websites. Now, we’ll dive deeper into em and rem. Let’s get started! What are em and rem and why use them? em is a CSS unit relative to the font size of the parent element, while rem is a CSS unit relative to the font size of an html element. Both of these are scalable units, meaning they give us the ability to scale elements up and down, relative to a set value. This adds more flexibility to our designs and makes our sites more responsive. A key reason to use scalable units like em and rem is accessibility. Accessibility enables all users, particularly those with disabilities, to successfully interact with a website. Using fixed units like px to set the values of elements, fonts, and space sizes does not give us this accessibility because fixed units do not scale.</p>
